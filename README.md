
## Goals

● Setup the Arduino circuits and connect the fan to make it work

● Sensors must be installed and programed so they can control the speed of the fan according to the temperature

● If the temperature goes up the fan speed must increase and vise versa

## Project Modules

1. Assembles : You had to assemble arduino chips with wires , bread board , lcd and FAN.

2. Components : Make sure that everything is attached correctly by testing every component of the system by coding into it .

3. Sensors : give sensors the ability of providing data to arduino with the help of coding .

4. Testing : Test the system under different circumstances if it is working fine or not
